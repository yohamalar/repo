Throw an exception: If the business requirement mandates that the branch with exactly 35 faculty members should exist, throw a BranchNotFoundException or another custom exception when it's not found.
Return an empty response: If the business logic allows for not finding a branch with 35 faculty members, return an empty response (e.g., null or an empty list) with an appropriate HTTP status code (404 Not Found or 204 No Content)
